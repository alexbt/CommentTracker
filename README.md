CommentTracker
==============

Forked from github.com/benbernard/CommentTracker


This version of the Chrome extension accomplishes the following:
- the labels are displayed/hide using the ThumbUp (+1);
- the list of unresolved comments is repeated at the bottom of the page;
- A success/warning message is displayed both at the top and bottom of the page;
- both the Discussion and Files tabs are covered.

The main issue: labels are not displayed immediately when a +1/thumb is applied. A refresh is required.
